====== 10 - Object Recognition ======

===== o Object detection =====

==== ▪ Know the difference between object detection and object identification ====

==== ▪ Describe the basic scheme used in object detection (such as face detection) ====

==== ▪ Describe the basic principle used when training a classifier for image classification (i.e. use both positive and negative examples) ====

==== ▪ Describe different types of features used for object detection (Viola-Jones, Histogram of Oriented Gradients, Local Binary Patterns) ====

==== ▪ Explain the basic principle of part-based models. ====

o Active appearance models (can be used for object identification)
▪ Mention applications of active appearance models
▪ Explain what is meant by a shape model and a texture model, respectively
▪ Describe the manual work involved in building/training an active appearance model.
▪ Explain why we need to apply translation, rotation and scale correction (-Procrustes
alignment) before applying PCA
o Neural network-based object recognition
▪ Describe a network architecture used for image classification
▪ Describe the concept of receptive field of a convolutional filter of two different layers
▪ What shapes do the convolutional filters take?
▪ Describe the concept of Object Proposals methods
▪ Describe the two approaches followed for object recognition/localization in images using
CNNs (Region-based CNN and YOLO)
