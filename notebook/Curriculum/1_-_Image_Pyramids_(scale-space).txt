====== 1 - Image Pyramids (scale-space) ======

===== Mention typical applications of feature detection, description, and matching. =====

===== Explain what an “interest point” is, and what such points can be used for. =====

===== Feature detection =====

==== Explain how the Harris corner detector works (at least for an axis-aligned corner…). ====

==== Explain how the blob detector works (i.e., the feature detection strategy used in SIFT). ====

===== Motivate the importance of “scale invariance” and “rotational invariance”. =====


===== Describe strategies for obtaining scale invariance and rotational invariance (e.g., automatic scale selection). =====


===== Describe different strategies for “feature description” (e.g., image patches and the SIFT descriptor). =====


===== Describe the basic principle of “feature matching”. =====


===== Mention typical applications of image pyramids. =====


===== Explain the steps involved in constructing a Gaussian pyramid. =====


===== Explain the link between image scale and the standard deviation of the Gaussian filter. =====


===== Explain how to construct a difference of Gaussian (DoG) pyramid. =====


===== Argue that the difference of Gaussian (DoG) operator is a reasonable approximation to the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) operator. =====


===== Describe the typical usage of DoG pyramids in feature detection (what type of feature are we typically looking for? How?). =====
