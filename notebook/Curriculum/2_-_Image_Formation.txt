====== 2 - Image Formation ======
Created Monday 07 February 2022

===== Cameras =====

==== Describe the geometry of the camera model/pinhole camera (e.g., center of projection, projection plane, principal point, focal length, etc.). ====

==== Explain the role of the calibration matrix (K) and the camera intrinsics. ====


==== Explain the role of the camera matrix (P) and the camera extrinsics. ====

==== Mention at least one strategy for camera calibration. ====

===== Projective geometry =====

==== Explain the geometry under perspective viewing (e.g., view point, rays, vanishing points, and horizon). ====

==== Mention examples of properties that remain – and do not remain – invariant under perspective viewing. ====

==== Explain and motivate the use of homogenous coordinates in projective geometry. ====

==== Define what is meant by a homography (=projective transformation), and know that it is only defined up to a scale. ====

==== Explain the basic steps involved in solving for an unknown homography using point correspondences. ====

==== Explain the basic steps in image rectification. ====

==== Argue that panoramic views can be generated using homographies ====

=== • when the camera centers are fixed (always!) ===

=== • when the camera centers change AND the imaged world object is planar. ===

==== Explain how to constrain feature matching using a global motion model (e.g., a homography) and RANSAC ====
