====== 3 - Stereo and epipolar geometry ======
Created Monday 07 February 2022

===== Explain the term disparity, for instance using the parallel two-camera setup. =====

===== Know what is meant by triangulation. =====

===== Explain the epipolar geometry for two camera views (e.g., epipoles, epipolar lines, epipolar plane). =====

===== Describe the epipolar constraint for calibrated and uncalibrated cameras, respectively (i.e., essential matrix versus fundamental matrix). =====

===== Motivate the use of stereo image rectification. =====

===== Describe the process followed in triangulation. How many points are needed in order to calculate the real-world coordinates (X)? =====

===== Explain how to compute the fundamental matrix (i.e., stereo pipeline with weak calibration). =====

===== Structure from motion (SFM) =====

==== Define the SFM problem. ====

==== Explain what happens to the reconstruction if there are no constraints on the camera matrix or on the scene. ====

==== Describe how to solve the SFM problem with ====

===== Photometric stereo =====

==== Explain the basic idea underlying photometric stereo (or “shape from light”). ====

==== Describe the basic principle of “depth from normals”. ====

===== Shading =====

==== Describe the basics of light transport ====

==== Illumination -> reflectance -> perception ====

==== Light sources ====

==== Types of reflection ====

==== Describe how shape from shading works ====

==== Mention strategies for estimating light source directions. ====
